# Notta .Net Codebase (Obsolete)

This repository served as the initial backend server for my Notta application.

https://notta.co.za/

Built with .Net, it first connected to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure before I moved to a Firebase Cloud Firestore db. My hope was that I could have a full-stack application making use of .Net and React (which I did for a few months) but the costs associated with hosting the .Net server code were too much for a little hobby project.

Therefore, I have since migrated to using a client-side Firebase implementation for Notta and this repository has become obsolete.

The code you will find here is not the prettiest or the best, and probably doesn't even follow many standards but it has been my first journey in creating a .Net backend on a personal project and I achieved what I wanted with it, even if I won't be making use of it anymore.

The code is in the Application folder, not sure what happened at the start when setting up this repo.
